Hello world!

Hieu here, I learn programming in college and failed it once. I retook the course and got a C. 
I decided that a C was not good enough to graduate so I change my major to Industrial Technology.
Ever since then, I have this fear of programming. It has now become a major roadblock in my career.
However, I am now trying again and committed to learning programming. I am starting with a Programming
Bootcamp for Web Development on Udemy. Wish me luck!
